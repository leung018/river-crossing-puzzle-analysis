# River Crossing Puzzle Analysis

This project aims to provide an automated solution for analyzing and finding the steps and moves in a given river crossing puzzle problem.

## How to Run

To compute the solution based on pre-configured rules and characters and print it in the console, use the following command:

```
./gradlew runReleaseExecutableNative
```

## Automated Testing

To ensure the quality of the codebase, all modules are thoroughly covered by unit tests.

## Future Directions

In future iterations, the project plans to allow users to customize the rules and characters involved in the puzzle. This enhancement will enable users to find solutions for their specific scenarios.
